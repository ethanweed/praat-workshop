I keep a running list of Praat tutorials and other related resources that have been useful to me. You can find it here: https://github.com/ethanweed/list-of-praat-resources

If you only look at one of these, make it http://praatscriptingtutorial.com. This the best introduction to Praat scripting that I have come across.
